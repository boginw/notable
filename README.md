It's a desktop app built for taking notes with *Markdown*. This makes it easy to write styled notes fast and effective. It is built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) which gives the possibility for cross-platform usage.  This app works on Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.
An ideal case for using this app would be a *Software Engineer*/*Computer Science* student.
